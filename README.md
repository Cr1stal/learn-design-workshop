# Front-End Development Workshop for Learn Prime
==========

### Expectations: After taking this workshop, students will know how to:
* Organize their stylesheets in a clean and efficient manner.
* Use the [Neat][Neat] grid framework to set the grid, lay out the composition of
  a website, and create a flexible and responsive grid. This also means
  understanding the basic 'box layout' structure and looking at both the 'bigger
  picture' and the smaller details at once.
* Use the [Bourbon][Bourbon] mixin library for greater efficiency in styling.
* Create their own mixins and extends to create a clean and modular stylesheet.
* Mark-up a website using semantic HTML 5, strongly influenced by the thoughtbot [style guides][Style].
* Deploy the website using Heroku and understanding the differences between the
  Development, Staging, and Production environments.
* Understand how to install gems (e.g. FontAwesome) and open-source libraries to
  build their toolkit and take advantage of using quality, already-made parts.
* Use Git and Github comfortably for version control, understanding how to
  follow the 'README.md' directions for gem installations.
